# London.weather

<p>It's Tuesday morning. You've packed your bag for work. A quick look in the mirror shows your bed hair is on point. Then you ask yourself that same question you've been asking your entire life, 'I wonder what the weather is like outside?'.</p>

<p>Instinct tells you to put your cup of tea down and look out the window. But we all know you cba. There is a better way.</p>

<p>London.weather tells you in nice big ELI5 text what the weather is.<p/>
